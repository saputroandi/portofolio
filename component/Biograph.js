            Hai i&apos;m web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every
            day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; dabbling with PHP
            and NodeJs. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.

        <div className="biograph-content">
          <p>
            <span></span>
            I&apos;m curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn
            something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to
            stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet
            challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="biograph-content">
          <p>
            <span></span>A slight clarification of the above: I&apos;m actually
            a graduates as automotive student cleverly disguised as a web
            developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be
            slightly more than difficult to make a living as mechanical
            engineering, I&apos;ve focused my energies on the web, which happily
            has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.
